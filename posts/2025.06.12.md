<h2 class="title">What is left in the mirror?</h2>

You didn't know me very well, and that's not your fault; one cannot know someone more than they are willing or able to reveal. But now that I'm gone, a distant memory you might consider fondly, or perhaps with a touch of unresolved anger, there are some things I'd wish for you to know--the secret lives I've lived, the quiet spaces I've held alone. Our lives are made up of thousands of such tiny moments; moments that are not shared if only because we live our lives mostly in the solitude of every day living.

<br/><br/>

At least once a week, when the weather wasn't bad, or at least when the rain fell straight down and not sideways, I'd stop at a little farmer's field about halfway through my drive to work. There, I would pet the cows. I'd talk to them about my morning, what I was afraid of, what I was working toward, what I hoped for. They listened contently, sometimes nodding, sometimes chewing, their large eyes placid. They came to know me, you see; they'd often run to my car when I pulled over, a small, unspoken welcome.

<br/><br/>

You likely didn't know I often spoke with an old man at the downtown Hillsboro coffee shop on most Tuesdays. I liked listening to Mr. Henderson recount his merchant marine days, his voice raspy, full of salt and distant ports, while I sipped my coffee. He always asked for extra pepper on his breakfast sandwich. It was a small, unspoken pact between two ghosts passing in the haze of nowhere.

<br/><br/>

Or that I enjoyed looking at antique maps--not of places I'd been, or even particularly wanted to go, but of places that couldn't truly be. Terra Australis Incognita, El Dorado, Atlantis, and others. I'd trace the fictional coastlines with a fingertip, imagining the minds that dreamed them, the sheer, bold audacity of inventing a world and committing it to paper. A cartography of pure thought. That's a kind of intelligence, isn't it? Believing in a beautifully crafted lie.

<br/><br/>

I loved reading the accounts of large, complex systems gone wrong. The ways wonderfully complex thought is subdivided down into beautifully intricate processes--and then, as if by magic, how it broke and shattered in ways nobody foresaw; I'd read about plane crashes, NASA incidents, autopsies, industrial accidents, and everything in between. Each account of humanity's hubris and our ongoing need to control chaos--and the need for chaos to push back. 

<br/><br/>

And did you ever catch me staring out the window during meetings? You probably thought I was bored--and, admittedly, sometimes I was. But mostly, I was crafting elaborate backstories for the pigeons on the ledge. That one with the gimpy leg? A disgraced avian detective, obviously, haunted by the one case he couldn't crack. The plump one, cooing incessantly? A celebrated opera singer, reduced to performing park bench arias. I had a whole avian soap opera playing out in my head, full of betrayals and unlikely alliances. It kept me sane, I suppose, when the spreadsheets blurred.

<br/><br/>

I loved reading certain books over and over again--mining the content for details I missed. The one with the most worn spine and dog-eared pages? It wasn't some highbrow literary tome; it was a battered copy of Carl Sagan's "Cosmos." I read it not because I fully grasped all the astrophysics, but because the sheer scale of it--billions and billions--made my own anxieties, my own quiet desperation, feel manageable. Almost insignificant. It was a comfort, like a weighted blanket made of stardust.

<br/><br/>

I used to write letters. Not emails, not texts, but actual, physical letters, addressed to writers and intellectuals and friends I admired, whose thoughts and philosophies had moved me. They were long, rambling things, often about a particular phrase or a twist of an idea I'd never considered. Most of them, I never sent. They live in a box in my closet, sealed, stamped with a hope for connection that my own tongue often failed to deliver. That was consideration, I think, wanting to tell someone their work or their thoughts mattered, even if I was too shy to drop the letter in the mail.

<br/><br/>

You never knew I curated a private internal museum of discarded things with stories. A single child's mitten, found on a park bench in December, its fuzzy blue yarn matted with what I imagined were tear-stains from a lost snowball fight, or a too-quick goodbye. A tarnished silver locket, empty, discovered near the bus stop, its clasp still stubbornly holding onto the ghost of a face. I'd write their fictional histories, these objects, give them lineages, grand adventures, quiet heartbreaks. It was a kind of hoarding of unknown history; an archivist of the almost-forgotten, a considerate cataloguer of lost sentiments. Each piece felt like a tiny monument to a life I'd never intersect.

<br/><br/>

My lunches, often eaten alone, usually at the little park by the civic center. There, I'd attempt to decipher the conversations of crows, a complex, squaking dialect I was convinced held the secrets to contentedness, or at least, the location of the best dropped crumbs and castoffs. I'd map their territories, their squabbles, their brief alliances--an amateur field naturalist in a concrete jungle, finding entire ecosystems in the ordinary. That was my own brand of intelligence, I suppose, seeing the intricate, seeing signs, where others just saw birds.

<br/><br/>

And how about the bad puns? The really, really bad ones, the kind that made you groan if I ever dared voice them. Mostly, they lived in my head, a constant, rolling commentary. The man that collected model boats? I called him "even-keeled". I'd see a fire hydrant and think, "Well, that's a watered-down job." It was an internal chuckle, a silly little coping mechanism for the relentless seriousness of things, a private comedy club where I was the only member--and thankfully, the only one who had to endure the act. 

<br/><br/>

Then there was my "perfect sentence" quest. Some nights, when the world was quiet, I'd sit with a notebook, not writing poetry or stories, but trying to craft one single, perfect sentence; a sentence that captured an entire feeling, a whole truth, with an economy of words so precise it hummed. Like trying to bottle lightning. Like trying to strike a tuning fork just right. I never truly succeeded, not really. But the pursuit itself, that wrestling with language, the endless revision of a thought until it gleamed--that was the point. A thoughtful obsession, a dedication to the atoms of meaning.

<br/><br/>

I also had this habit of noting the pennies on the street. Not for luck, I've never been a man of superstition. I'd wonder about the journey of that single cent: whose pocket had it fallen from? What tiny transaction was it meant for before it found its way to the grimy asphalt? A child's candy? A fraction of a dream? I'd consider polishing them sometimes, but I never did. The idea of making Lincoln shine again was an enticing one--then leave them on park benches, in phone booths (when they still existed), or on top of newspaper boxes for someone else to find. A small, anonymous circulation of something once deemed meaningless, then forgotten--then, perhaps, noticed anew. A quiet act of re-gifting insignificance.

<br/><br/>

On Saturday mornings, if the week had been particularly loud or bruising, I'd go to Powell's books with my kids, not to read, but to wander the deepest, most forgotten stacks--the sections on obscure agricultural practices from the 1920s, or nautical engineering texts printed before the Great War. I'd open as many volumes as I could manage in the meager time allotted. I loved the smell of old paper, of silent knowledge, the sheer weight of unvisited thoughts. It was like bathing in a baptism of forgotten ink.

<br/><br/>

I also kept a "compliment journal". Not for compliments I received. No, this was for overheard kindnesses. A stranger telling another, "That color looks wonderful on you" at the pharmacy. A kid at the park sharing their swing without being asked. I'd jot them down, these fleeting sparks of goodwill between others. It was my private anthology of ambient decency, a reminder that even in the static of everyday life, there were notes of grace playing if you tuned your ears just right. That's consideration, isn't it? To actively listen for the good.

<br/><br/>

I had a peculiar fondness for instruction manuals--mostly for things I'd never own and would never use: a 1980s synthesizer, a Toyota pickup truck, a sextant. I'd read them thoroughly, fascinated by the precise language, the assumption of a reader's dedication to mastering a skill. The intricate diagrams were like abstract art. It was a form of mental travel, inhabiting the mind of someone about to create, or navigate, or build; a contemplative exploration of potential and admiration for expertise.

<br/><br/>

On rainy afternoons, if I had the house to myself, I'd put on old vinyl--not the popular stuff, but obscure alternative artists with stories in their voices--and I would try to learn one new, intricate knot. A sheepshank, a bowline on a bight, a zeppelin bend. My fingers, mostly accustomed to tapping keyboards and the occasional guitar, would fumble, then find the rhythm. There was a quiet satisfaction in it, tangling and untangling, creating strength from simple strands of rope.

<br/><br/>

You never knew about my "people watching bingo". I'd watch for things like "someone tripping but recovering gracefully," "an unabashed public display of affection," or "stranger performs a random act of tiny kindness." I didn't shout "Bingo!" in the coffee shop, obviously. It was a silent game, a way to find the patterns, the humor, the small, shared humanity in the everyday ballet.

<br/><br/>

Or my secret conversations with statues and cemetary headstones. Not out loud, mostly. But I'd pause by that bronze soldier in the park, the forgotten poet on his plinth, or the ancient tombstone that no longer receives visits--and I'd offer them my thoughts on the current state of affairs, ask if they missed the horse-drawn carriages, or if they ever got tired of the pigeons. A contemplative dialogue with stillness, imagining their stoic replies. 

<br/><br/>

And did you know I collected fallen leaves? Only the perfectly formed ones, in impossible, fleeting shades of autumn. I'd press them in heavy books, not to display, but just to have them, like captured sunsets, tangible echoes of a season's blaze. An appreciation for the transient beauty that exists around all of us.

<br/><br/>

I had a ritual for the times I finished a truly magnificent book, one that resonated deep in my bones: I'd take it outside, under the stars if possible, and just hold it for a while, letting the story settle like dust upon a mantle. It was a quiet wake for the world I was leaving, a moment of gratitude for the journey. 

<br/><br/>

Then there were the ridiculously specific playlists I curated for moods you never even knew I had: "Contemplating the existential dread of laundry day," "That feeling when you find a forgotten fiver in a coat pocket," "Uh-oh, I'm remembering embarrassing shit again," "Upbeat songs for a depressed fellow who can't drink coffee," "Music for successfully assembling IKEA furniture without tears." They were soundtracks to the unglamorous, the microscopic dramas and triumphs of a life. A humorous, precise categorization of my inner soundscape.

<br/><br/>

You'd never guess I sometimes read the terms and conditions out loud to my rubber duck debugger. She was a captive audience, of course. But it was about the language, the ludicrous formality, the sheer, unyielding density of it. I'd do it with a theatrical flourish, finding the absurdity, often trying to imitate great Shakespearean actors. It was my way of engaging with the bureaucratic maze, and Mrs. Quackington seemed to appreciate the cadence, if not the content.

<br/><br/>

I kept a small, smooth stone in my backpack. Not a lucky charm, exactly. More like a worry stone that had heard a thousand unspoken anxieties. I'd trace its coolness, its contours, when the world felt too sharp, too loud. A tactile anchor to the present, a silent, contemplative companion. It knew the weight of things I never voiced.

<br/><br/>

I used to write letters to my future self, but not about grand ambitions or profound regrets. More like: "Remember that awful haircut from May '98? Don't do that again." Or, "Did you ever figure out the name of that song that that one colleague always hummed off-key?" I sealed them and hid them away--little time capsules of minor perplexities and cautions. 

<br/><br/>

There was also my clandestine war against poorly-placed apostrophes on public signage. "Tomato's for sale." It was an affront. I didn't vandalize. But I'd mentally correct them, sometimes whispering the correction under my breath. A small, internal crusade for grammatical integrity. A pedantic passion for precision. 

<br/><br/>

You also never knew I kept a small collection of "Lost Sounds" in a notebook. Tiny scribbles where I'd tried to describe ephemeral noises: "The particular sigh of an old bus kneeling at a stop," "The whisper of a page turning in an empty room," "The distant, mournful call of a train late at night." An impossible archive of the almost-inaudible, an attempt to hold onto the ghosts of a passing moment.

<br/><br/>

Or that I'd sometimes buy slightly damaged fruit at the market--the bruised apple, the pear with a soft spot--because I felt a strange, gentle pity for them. I'd take them home and treat them like tiny invalids--overlooked and imperfect--making sure they were eaten first. A ridiculous kind of compassion for the easily discarded.

<br/><br/>

And did you ever see me tracing patterns in spilled coffee, or the frost on a winter window? I wasn't just absent-minded. I was looking for fleeting maps, imaginary constellations, secret messages from the universe written in momentary stains.

<br/><br/>

You didn't know I assigned personalities to the trees I passed regularly. That gnarled oak on the corner? An irascible but wise old professor with a monocle. Always a monocle. The slender birch by the river? A shy artist, whispering verses to the wind. It made my walks feel like a series of quiet encounters with old friends.

<br/><br/>

I had a habit of listening to conversations in languages I didn't understand on the bus or in cafes. I wouldn't try to decipher words, but I'd listen to the melody, the cadence, the emotion in the tones, imagining the stories being told. It felt like hearing pure human connection, unburdened by literal meaning; an appreciation for the music of dialogue. I suspect they were only discussing the burdens of every day living, and somehow that made it even more important.

<br/><br/>

You'd never guess I tried to teach myself to play the harmonica using only YouTube tutorials and sheer, stubborn hope. Mostly, it sounded like a surprised goose. But sometimes, in the dead of night, when I thought no one could hear, a single, clear, wistful note would escape--a tiny triumph in my solitary, off-key conservatory. 

<br/><br/>

I kept a list of "perfectly ordinary good things": "The smell of rain on hot asphalt," "Finding a parking spot right away," "The way a cat stretches after a nap," "The smell of an old book," "The taste of that first cup of coffee." It wasn't profound, just a catalog of small joys; a bulwark against the bigger sorrows and acknowledgment of beauty in the unremarkable.

<br/><br/>

On clear nights, I'd sometimes lie on my back in the yard and try to find the quietest star. Not the brightest, but the most distant, faintest speck. The one that seemed to whisper rather than shout its light across the void. A contemplative search for the universe's shyest resident.

<br/><br/>

You wouldn't have known I had a favorite lamppost on my evening walk, the one that flickered just so. I'd stop beneath it some nights, and tell it about the subtle shifts in moonlight, or the taste of the evening air. It was a stoic friend, casting a reliable circle in the encroaching gloom.

<br/><br/>

And you'd probably never guess I tried to learn just the endings of half-forgotten songs--ones written, sometimes, before music notation was invented. Only the last wistful bar, the final, fading chord. Not the whole melody, just that trailing note of departure. It felt like catching the sigh after a story is told, a collection of musical goodbyes to histories that remain unknown.

<br/><br/>

I had a list filled with "Almost Words"--syllables I'd mishear, or jumbles from dreams that sounded like they should mean something profound, but didn't quite exist. I'd ponder their potential definitions, as a sometimes lexicographer of the ethereal.

<br/><br/>

Sometimes, on my lunch break, I'd follow a single ant across the vast expanse of a paving stone, imagining its epic journey, its tiny triumphs and perceived perils. A miniature safari in the mundane, a contemplative dive into a drastically different scale of existence.

<br/><br/>

And I kept a personal account of the shadows on particularly sunny days, noting the way the evening light stretched the shadow of a fencepost into an impossibly long, thin creature, or how my own shadow seemed to wave back from the wall.

<br/><br/>

And the regret? Oh, it's a heavy cloak now, this knowing I could have shared these little constellations of self, these private orbits. Maybe you would have understood. Maybe you would have seen the patterns in my quiet, in my jokes that landed a bit sideways, in the way I always seemed to be listening to something just beyond the conversation. These small, unpolished facets, these peculiar quirks of a mind you barely grazed--they don't change the big picture, perhaps. But they fill in the shadows, don't they? Add a little unexpected color to the monochrome you might have painted me in. The remorse isn't that I lived them; it's that I locked the door, kept the curtains drawn, and never invited you in for a look around. The way we all do.

<br/><br/>

So now you know. A little more. Not enough, never enough. But a start. A postscript to a life you thought you knew. Maybe file it away with the fond memories. Or the angry ones. Just... file it.

<br/><br/>

Know the cows knew some part of me. And the crows probably did too. And Mr. Henderson, with his pepper. And all the internal museums and archives and lists. And the precious few friends that were more observant than I realized. We all tried so hard, I suppose. 

<br/><br/>

And now, perhaps, you know, too.
