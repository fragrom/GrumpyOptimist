Around the lamp, they huddle, my kids. Their faces glow. 

Drinking in the chaos I spin from the stories I've lived.

And I am so damn thankful they don’t see the heat that forged these words.

The raw nerve of it. The gut-punch of being alone and unloved. The invisible boy drowning in thoughts he couldn’t even spell.

Their innocence is born from naivety. It’s pure. Experience is the jagged mark left behind.

Sometimes I wish these lines on my soul were smoother. Smoother than river stones.

Other times I want more of them. More proof. Proof that we’re never really satisfied. Proof I walked through the fires. 

Because happiness? It feels like surrender. Like weakness.

This world. It demanded everything from us. Our eyes, our hands, our attention. We gave it. No hesitation.

And this is the wreckage, right? This is the noise that stays. This is the static that churns.

Most days I want to be emptied. Like a shell. Hollowed out. And have someone else, someone better, step in and take my place.

Then everyone could breathe easy, knowing I’m still here. And I could finally have relief. Vanish. Some cosmic idea, a wisp.

But nobody gets that lucky.

And still. 

Still, I see the echo of my own stories in their wide-open eyes. 

And in their laughter, there’s this undeniable spark.

A garden grows within them. 

A stubborn, defiant bloom.
