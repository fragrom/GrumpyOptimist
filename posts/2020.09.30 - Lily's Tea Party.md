**Tea Party**

Lillian invites me to tea parties
<br/>
She says it’s our birthday
<br/>
Blow out candles on toy plastic cake 
<br/>
Tip the teapot and pour pretend tea 
<br/>
Sip from our saucers and sit quietly
<br/><br/>

She’s been singing happy birthday
<br/>
Twenty times a day now
<br/>
Her four-year-old hands are clean
<br/>
Germs, germs, germs she hears
<br/>
Parents wish for more birthdays but
<br/>
Maybe this isn’t what we had in mind
<br/><br/>


Most days this fear is trailing close
<br/>
Two clenched fists about my neck
<br/>
My cape as a reluctant superhero
<br/>
Fluttering frantically in the wind
<br/>
Like a white flag behind a pickup
<br/><br/>


It could've been a beautiful thing
<br/><br/>


She asked me how things change
<br/>
And never go back to normal
<br/>
About getting old and
<br/>
How darkness moves 
<br/>
With light and speed 
<br/><br/>

And I had the audacity to tell her
<br/>
She’d understand someday
