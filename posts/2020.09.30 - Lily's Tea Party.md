Lillian invites me to tea parties
She says it’s our birthday
Blow out candles on toy plastic cake 
Tip the teapot and pour pretend tea 
Sip from our saucers and sit quietly

She’s been singing happy birthday
Twenty times a day now
Her four-year-old hands are clean
Germs, germs, germs she hears
Parents wish for more birthdays but
Maybe this isn’t what we had in mind

Most days this fear is trailing close
Two clenched fists about my neck
My cape as a reluctant superhero
Fluttering frantically in the wind
Like a white flag behind a pickup

It could've been a beautiful thing

She asked me how things change
And never go back to normal
About getting old and
How darkness moves 
With light and speed 

And I had the audacity to tell her
She’d understand someday
