I spent a few hours at the Portland airport today. Not as a traveler, but as a person picking up other weary travelers after their long trip. 

There's something pure about an airport. 

I think about it every time I walk through one--especially when I'm not traveling from one end of the world to another, but instead picking people up from their travels. The relative beauty of an airport doesn't really exist when you're using one; you're just too tired, too exhausted, too willing to ignore beauty in the things around you. And I think that's okay. Travel is hard.  

But airports are such a wonderful distillation of humanity: tearful goodbyes between parents and children, brothers and sisters, spouses and lovers; loving embraces, squeals of delight, kisses, hugs, fast explained stories of travel adventures, of longing for one another, of wanting to be in the lives of another and instead being elsewhere. 

Airports remind me of attending weddings. It's a place we're allowed to declare our joy for one another, our sorrow for them being gone from our lives; we're allowed to love openly, for just a moment; shed tears of joy or sorrow for love coming or going; where love is expressed openly and willingly because it is a demarcation point between here and there. It's a boundary that we intrinsically understand--we know our love will follow another human being wherever they go, even if we cannot go with them.
